# NLP Challenge – AI Fellowship

This repository contains my solution for the **NLP Challenge** as part of the [Fellowship.AI](https://fellowship.ai) program.

## 📌 Challenge Overview

- **Task**: Perform Sentiment Analysis using the **IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews**.
- **Goal**: Classify movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative** using NLP techniques and machine learning.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle – [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
- The dataset consists of 50,000 labeled movie reviews for binary sentiment classification.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- NLTK / SpaCy for text preprocessing
- TensorFlow / Keras for modeling
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## 🔎 Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing punctuation and stopwords
   - Tokenization and padding

2. **Model**:
   - Built a deep learning model using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** layers for sequence learning.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Achieved high accuracy and good generalization performance.
   - Visualized training and validation accuracy/loss.

## ✅ Results

- **Training Accuracy**: ~XX%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~XX%
- Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Classification Report are included in the notebook.
